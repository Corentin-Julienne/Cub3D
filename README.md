# Cub3D

## 🗣️ About

Cub3D is a project from the cursus of School 42. The goal is to make a little 3D game engine which is based on Ray Casting. It will render a 3D environment that ressemble an old school video games such as Duke Nukem or Doom.

## 🛠️ Features and explanations

### Map parsing

The game engine should be able to parse any kind of map, as long as they respect the requirements (see the subject PDF for more information). The program will check that all the requirements are met, and will throw an error if necessary. However, [continue] 

### Implementation of a Ray Casting algorithm

The most difficult feature to implement is the creation of a ray casting algorithm from scratch, in C.  [implement that later]

## 💿 Compilation and execution

To compile the program, execute the Makefile command ```make``` and execute it with ```./cub3d <relative_path_to_map>```

## 🗑️ Deletion

To destroy the executable and obj files, use ```make fclean```. To only destroy obj files without destroying the executable, use ```make clean```. 

## ✅ Validation

The project has been validated with a final mark of 100/100.
